# OOP
Laboratory Assignments for Object Oriented Programming Course.

### Lab one
Create a simple class in Java.

### Lab two
Design a Student Management System for the university. 

### Lab three
Program that monitors and detects changes in docu- ments within a designated folder.

### Lab four
Comprehensive implementation of fundamental data structures in Java, focusing on Stacks and Queues.

#### Stack implementation:
- `LinkedStack`: Utilizes a singly linked list, allowing for dynamic resizing.
- `DynamicArrayStack`: Implements a stack with a dynamic array, which resizes according to need, up to a set maximum capacity.
- `ArrayStack`: A traditional stack implementation using a fixed-size array.

#### Queue Implementations:
- `ArrayQueue`: Implements a circular queue using a fixed-size array, optimizing space utilization.
- `LinkedQueue`: Utilizes a linked list, providing dynamic resizing capabilities.
- `DynamicArrayQueue`: A queue implementation using a dynamic array that adjusts its capacity as needed, within predefined limits.

Each implementation includes fundamental operations like `push` and `pop` for stacks, and `enqueue` and `dequeue` for queues. A `toString` method is also included in each class for easy visualization of the data structure's current state.
